                <h1>Hello, my name is Charles-Anthony</h1><hr>

                <p>I'm a 4th year university student in biology and I'm expected to graduate this year.<br>Here's a few facts about me in terms of what I like to do and hobbies:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I play a lot of rackett sports, mostly badminton and tennis, but recently a lot of pickleball</li>
                    <li>I'm really into fitness, I run and go to the gym regularly</li>
                    <li>I like travelling (like everyone else)</li>
                    <li>I recently started leaning how to cook so I don't starve the day I'm on my own</li>
                    <li>I'm a studious person, I like to study and value my academics</li>
                    <li>I've played video games pretty much my entire life, I naturally have an interest in CS</li>
                    <li>I also aspire to build a small SaaS product, which is mainly why I registered to this course to learn the basics</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <p>For the Fall 2025 semester, I have <strong style="color: red">14 credits</strong> registered as seen on the table below:</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:60px">
                    Therefore I'm registered to 14 credits, however I will only gain <strong style="color: red">12 credits</strong><br>
                    I will need <strong style="color: red">15 credits</strong> in the Winter 2025 semester to graduate on time. All my core &amp; concentration courses will be done, so I will have only free option courses left to complete<br>
